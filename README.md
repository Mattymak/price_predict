# price_predict
# Real Estate Price Predictor 🏠

This project is a simple machine learning model that predicts housing unit prices based on features like location, size, and building attributes. It is part of my data science learning journey, focusing on applying regression models in real-world scenarios.

## 📌 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Linear regression model for price prediction
- Evaluation metrics for model performance

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `price_predict.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run the cells to explore and test the model

## 📂 Dataset
This dataset is not real.

## 📈 Sample Output
Include a screenshot of the plot or final prediction output (optional but nice to have).
